This program has not been modified in a way where the original input is affected, so the original instructions should work since that is what I used the whole time. I had to change the print because I wasn't fully understanding the layout of it and understood the arrays better, like switching max, min, and seeing the root and leaf nodes. Everything is added and should work. Other than that, I left the original functions alone and added the ones you asked.
