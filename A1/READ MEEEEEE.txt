Deques are double ended queues essentially. Many programming languages implement them, more importantly they implement them differently. Python has them work as doubly linked lists with fixed length subarrays. They provide the functions append, appendLeft, pop, and popLeft. Java have 2 implementations, one using linked lists, and the other using resizable arrays. C++ has the best implementation with random access being constant time and very stable. C on the other hand has nothing for deques, so you'll have to implement your own. Python has it built for threading if you need to do that for your code, but only has append/pop functions.
