This project is going to show the use case of some data structures. We will test cases with linked lists, stacks, heaps, and a BST.
With each data structure, we are going to test how fast some are, what type of data they work best with, and actually demonstate.
For example, we will time how long it takes to fetch a maximum number, a minimum number, a random number, and use the same
exact input for each data structure, so we know that the input isn't a factor. 
For random values, we used an array to hold the values, and that is
